## 📰 **Feature Update: Trending in AI News Section**

**Date**: 9 November 2025

### ✅ **Objective**: Implement a "Trending in AI" section on the homepage.

This feature was added to provide users with the latest news and developments in the field of artificial intelligence, fetched from a live, external source.

### 🚀 **Features Implemented**:

-   **Live News API Integration**:
    -   Initially attempted several RSS feeds (TechCrunch, Ars Technica) which proved unreliable for consistent image and content delivery.
    -   Pivoted to the industry-standard **News API** (`newsapi.org`) for robust and reliable data.
    -   Implemented a dedicated API route (`/api/news`) to fetch, filter, and serve the news articles. The route now specifically requests AI-related news and filters for articles that are guaranteed to have a featured image.

-   **Dynamic Homepage Component (`/components/trending-news.tsx`)**:
    -   Displays the top 4 latest AI news articles in a clean, responsive grid.
    -   Each article card shows the featured image, source, publication date, title, and a brief snippet.
    -   Includes a loading state with a skeleton UI for a professional user experience.
    -   If the live API fails, it gracefully falls back to mock data to ensure the page is never empty.

-   **On-Site Article Viewer (`/news/[...slug]/page.tsx`)**:
    -   Clicking a news card navigates the user to a dedicated article page within the AI Bytes platform.
    -   This prevents users from navigating away from the site.

-   **Advanced Web Scraper (`/api/scrape`)**:
    -   When a user visits an article page, a backend API scrapes the content from the original source URL in real-time.
    -   The scraper uses `@mozilla/readability` to extract the core article content, removing ads, navigation, and other clutter.
    -   It intelligently removes the featured image from the article body to prevent duplication.
    -   The scraper mimics a real browser by setting a `User-Agent` header to avoid being blocked.

-   **Robust Error Handling**:
    -   In cases where a specific article cannot be scraped, the article page displays a user-friendly error message.
    -   This message includes a direct link to the "Read Original Article" on the source website, ensuring the user can always access the content.

### 挑战与解决方案 (Challenges & Solutions):

-   **Unreliable RSS Feeds**: Early attempts were hampered by inconsistent data from RSS feeds, especially missing images. **Solution**: Switched to the professional News API.
-   **Scraping Failures**: Some news sites employ anti-scraping measures. **Solution**: Implemented a scraper that mimics a browser and added robust fallback error handling for the user.
-   **Build Errors**: Encountered build errors due to experimental and unnecessary packages (`playwright-core`, `chrome-aws-lambda`). **Solution**: Removed the faulty packages and simplified the scraping logic to a more reliable `fetch`-based approach.

### 📊 **Final Technology Stack for News Feature**:

-   **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **Data Fetching**: News API (`newsapi.org`)
-   **Web Scraping**: `node-fetch`, `jsdom`, `@mozilla/readability`, `cheerio`
